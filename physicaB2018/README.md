## Note

To run the scripts it is required to have the [BornAgain software](http://bornagainproject.org/) installed. The installation instructions are available [here](http://bornagainproject.org/documentation/installation).

### List of scripts

- `simulate.py` is the script to perform a simulation and plot it. Uncommenting line `213`, one can save the result to an ascii file.
